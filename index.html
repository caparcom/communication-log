      <p>Radio check. Pilot, please confirm.</p>
      <p>Message 2</p>
      <p>Really...Message 2? that's what I have to work with huh? My Pilot 
         can't even come up with something remotely funny, and/or informative. That's fine,
         we'll fix that when we get back to base. Now, what do you see from up there?

      <p>As one in your position should know, the first message is a test to see that I am speaking with the correct person.  Your response has me questioning whether or not such sensitive
         information should be shared without verifying your identity.
